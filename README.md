:shipit: I'm a cybersecurity engineering student  
-----------

I'm 22 years old and I'm a student in network and system engineering with a specialization in cybersecurity at ISTY in the University of Paris Saclay. 
I'm also developing my skills in ethical hacking through various means such as websites and books. You'll find below my skills, hobbies and work.

:trident: Good reading boss!                                                     
* I am based in France and more precisely in Paris
* :e-mail: You contact me at [zoran.tauvry@ens.uvsq.fr](mailto:zoran.tauvry@ens.uvsq.fr)
* :mortar_board: Currently, alongside my studies, I'm training in pentesting via various sites such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox, and soon RootMe. But also through books such as "Ethical Hacking: Learn to attack and defend yourself (6th edition)" or "Metasploit sécurité & Hacking, le guide du pentesteur, by David Kennedy".

* :brain: I sometimes have several hobbies such as video games:video_game:, sports:rugby_football:, literature:books: and music:musical_keyboard:
