I'm 22 years old and I'm a student in network and system engineering with a specialization in cybersecurity at ISTY in the University of Paris Saclay. 
I'm also developing my skills in ethical hacking through various means such as websites and books. You'll find below my skills, hobbies and work.

Good reading !

* :mortar_board: In networks, I mainly study TCP/IP (Internet, Intranet, Extranet) network architecture, algorithms and protocols, and the associated communications services. In telecoms, we focus on PSTN architecture, ATM networks and signaling. In systems, we study different types of application architecture audits encountered in networks (Linux/Windows), followed by a general exercise (Pentest) carried out progressively throughout the module.We also study databases such as MySQL and MariaDB, as well as computer languages such as C, Python and PHP.
